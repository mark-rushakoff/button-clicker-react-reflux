# Button Clicker React Reflux

This is a simple demonstration of (what I believe to be) good practices in structuring a React/Reflux single page application.

## Usage

### Developing

`lineman run` will start a development server with the app at http://localhost:8000.

`lineman spec` will start the spec server in the terminal; the spec server will also be accessible at http://localhost:7357.
